# Handwritten Digit Recognition using PyTorch (MNIST)
This project implements a complete handwritten digit recognition system using PyTorch. It supports model training, image preprocessing, prediction, and result visualization. Ideal for beginners and developers learning about deep learning, image classification, and model deployment.

## Features

1.Two Model Options: A classic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a simpler Fully Connected Network (SimpleFC).

2.Advanced Image Preprocessing: Automatically crops, resizes, centers, binarizes, inverts, and normalizes input images to match the MNIST format.

3.End-to-End Training Pipeline: Downloads MNIST dataset, trains with data augmentation (rotation, scaling, translation).

4.Prediction Visualization: Shows original image, processed image, and a confidence bar chart.

5.Custom Image Recognition: Easily test with your own handwritten digit photos or drawings.

## Requirements
Install dependencies using pip:
 pip install torch 
 pip install torchvision 
 pip install matplotlib 
 pip install pillow
